# Login/Signup Error

If you have followed all the steps, especially step no. 3 and using Chrome browser for initial testing and you're unable to login or signup, then try changing the Chrome browser for initial testing and it will work. Because Chrome sometimes doesn't reload the files.
4-5 issues are regarding this error only!!
